what is scalability?;; ability to handle increasing workloads by upgrading existing hardware or by adding more components
what is scale up?;; upgrade existing hardware
what is scale out?;; add more components
what is elasticity?;; ability to scale automatically base on the load
what are load balancers?;; device or service that distributes network traffic dynamically across resources
what is elb?;; elastic load balancer is a fully managed load balancing service
what is asg?;; auto scaling group is a managed service to implement elasticity by scaling out based on demand

# load balancers
why use a load balancer?;;
	balance load among servers
	expose single dns ip
	instances failure
	ssl to websites
	high availability across zones
types of load balancers;;
	application load balancer - layer 7
	network load balancer - layer 4
	gateway load balancer - layer 3
application load balancer features;;
	http/https/grpc
	static url
network load balancer features;;
	tcp/udp
	high performance
	static ip
gateway load balancer features;;
	geneve
	firewalls
	intrusion detection

# scaling strategies
what is a manual scaling?;; scaling strategy done by a physical user
what is a step scaling?;; scaling strategy done on an alarm per instance
what is a target tracking scaling?;; scaling strategy done on an alarm per scaling group
what is a schedule scaling?;; scaling strategy done on at a specific time
what is a predictive scaling?;; scaling strategy handle by ml models
