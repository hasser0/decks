# aurora & rds
aurora serverless use cases;; infrequent intermittent and unpredictable workloads
rds snapshots use cases;; to change rds settings such as size, region, etc
rds multi region use cases;; disaster recovery and global reads
up to ... rds read replicas can be deployed;; 15
only ... rds multi-az can be deployed;; one

# dynamodb
how does dynamodb handle security?;; using iam
main dynamodb feature?;; single digit millisecond latency
why is dynamodb so fast?;; because it autoscales horizontally
while dax ..., elasticache ...;; is just for dynamodb ... can be used for any database
dynamodb global tables make dynamodb tables ...;; accessible to read/write in mulitple regions
