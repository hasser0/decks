what is cloud formation?;; iac service to manage infrastructure using declarative language
what is cdk?;; cloud develoment kit is a tool to manage infrastructure using a programming language
what is elastic beanstalk?;; service to deploy 3-tier architectures all in a single view
what is cloud deploy?;; service to deploy applications on ec2 instances or on premises servers
what is code commit?;; source control service
what id code build?;; serverless service to build, run and test artifacts
what is code pipeline?;; fully managed service to orchestrate ci/cd pipelines well integrated with code family

what is cloud9?;; cloud ide
what is code star?;; centralize service to create, manage and view all code family/cloud9 services
what is ssm agent?;; systems manager agent is a tool to manage ec2 instances and on premise servers

# cloud formation
saving strategy by using cloud formation?;; automate deletion or creation of templates no working hours
do declarated cloud formation resources need to be defined in order?;; no, cloud formation can figure out the order
which service is used to visualize cloud formation templates?;; application composer
cloud formation use case;; recreate infrastructure using code in different environments, regions or accounts

# cdk
how cdk works internally?;; it creates cloud formation json or yaml file from the code
cdk use case;; deploy infrastructure along with code, for example lambda functions or ecs

# elastic beanstalk
elastic beanstalk use case;; scaling and configuration concerns but want to focus on code
what type of cloud service is elastic beanstalk?;; is paas
how is elastic beanstalk billed?;; the platform is free but you pay for deployed resources
what is the customer responsable for in elastic beanstalk?;; only for the code
elastic beanstalk architectures(3);; single instance, asg and elb + asg

# code family
how is codebuild billed?;; you pay only for the build time
code artifact use case;; to save packages
what is the new replacement for code star?;; code catalyst

# ssm
with ssm system manager you can ...;; patch os automatically and configure multiple servers at the same time
with ssm session manager you can ...;; access instances without ssh
with ssm parameter store you can ...;; save secrets and configuration variables
