# route53
simple routing policy ...;; redirect the traffic, no health checks
weighted routing policy ...;; redirect among multiple instances
latency routing policy ...;; redirect to minimize latency
failover routing policy ...;; redirect in case of failure for disaster recovery

# cloudfront
while cloudfront ..., s3 cross region replication ...;; cache content around the world ... s3 crr is for read replication in specific regions
cloudfront use case;; get s3 and http content is cached at edge locations
cloudfront security features;; oac and ddos protection
how is cloudfront used with s3?;; to cache s3 content, websites or to upload data
how is cloudfront used with custom origins?;; cache http requests to elb or ec2
cloudfront integrate with ... to protect against web attacks;; waf and shield

# global
main s3 transfer accelerator use case;; reduce s3 upload latency
s3 transfer accelerator reduce latenct by ...;; uploading files to edge locations and route traffic over aws internal network
global accelerator reduce latency by ...;; using edge locations and route traffic over aws internal network
while cloudfront ..., global accelerator ...;; cache content ... improves requests times
who is responsable for physical security on outposts?;; the customer
advantages of outposts over aws?;;
	low latency from on premises
	local processing
	easier migration

# architecture
which of region/zone factor affect latency?;; region
which of region/zone factor affect availability?;; region an zone
