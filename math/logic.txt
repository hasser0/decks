# Formal languages
formal languages parts;;
    symbols
    rules for wff
    translation rules from/to natural languages
types of symbols;;
    connectives \( \land \lor \lnot \rightarrow \leftrightarrow \)
    logical (connectives plus parenthesis)
    sentence(non logical)
expression;; sequence of symbols
rules of wff;;
    sentences are wff
    \( (\lnot \alpha), (\alpha \lor \beta), (\alpha \land \beta), (\alpha \rightarrow \beta), (\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta) \) are wff
    wff are build by applying previous finite number of times
formula building operations;; \( \varepsilon_\square \) where \( \square \) is a connective symbol
construction sequence;; \( \varepsilon_1, \cdots, \varepsilon_n \) sequence of expressions such either
    \( \varepsilon_i \) is a sentence
    \( \varepsilon_i = \epsilon_\lnot(\varepsilon_j) \ j < i \)
    \( \varepsilon_i = \epsilon_\square(\varepsilon_j, \varepsilon_k) \ j,k < i \)
\induction principle;; the set \( S \) containing all sentence symbols and close under formula building operations is the set of all wff
