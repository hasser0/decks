# Formal languages
formal languages parts;;
    symbols
    rules for wff
    translation rules from/to natural languages
types of symbols;;
    connectives \( \land \lor \lnot \rightarrow \leftrightarrow \)
    logical (connectives plus parenthesis)
    sentence(non logical)
expression;; sequence of symbols
rules of wff;;
    sentences are wff
    \( (\lnot \alpha), (\alpha \lor \beta), (\alpha \land \beta), (\alpha \rightarrow \beta), (\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta) \) are wff
    wff are build by applying previous finite number of times
formula building operations;; \( \varepsilon_\square \) where \( \square \) is a connective symbol
construction sequence;; \( \varepsilon_1, \cdots, \varepsilon_n \) sequence of expressions such either
    \( \varepsilon_i \) is a sentence
    \( \varepsilon_i = \epsilon_\lnot(\varepsilon_j) \ j < i \)
    \( \varepsilon_i = \epsilon_\square(\varepsilon_j, \varepsilon_k) \ j,k < i \)
induction principle;;
    if \( S \) is a set of wff containing all sentence symbols
    and \( S \) close under five formula building operations
    then \( S \) is the set of all wff

# Truth assignments
truth assignment;; \( v: S \rightarrow \{T,F\} \)
    \( S \) set of sentence symbols
truth assignment extension;; \( \bar{v}: \bar{S} \rightarrow \{T,F\} \)
    \( \bar{S} \) set of wff
\( \bar{v}\) satisfies \( \varphi \);; if \( \bar{v}(\varphi) = T \)
compactness theorem;; If every finite subset of \( \Sigma \) is satisfied, then \( \Sigma \) is satisfied
\( \Sigma \models \tau \) (tautologically implies);; all truth assignments for sentences in \( \Sigma, \tau \) that satisfies \( \Sigma \) also satisfies \( \tau \)
tautologically equivalent;; \( \sigma \models \tau \) and \( \tau \models \sigma \)
tautology;; \( \varnothing \models \tau \)
vacuosly implies;; no exists truth assignment that satisfies \( \Sigma \)
