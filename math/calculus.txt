# Fundamentals
real axioms;;
    associative (addition/multiplication)
    commutative (addition/multiplication)
    identity (addition/multiplication)
    inverse (addition/multiplication)
    closure (addition/multiplication)
    distributive
    trichotomy
    least upper bound
least upper bound axiom;; if \( A \) is a not an empty set and has an upper bound, then it has a minimum upper bound
dense set;; a subset \( A \) in \( B \) such that any subset of \( B \) contains at least one element of \( A \)

# Limits and continuity
limit definition;;
    \[ \lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x) = L \]
    \[ \equiv \]
    \[ \forall \epsilon > 0 \ \exists\delta > 0: (0<|x -a|<\delta)\rightarrow (|f(x)-L|<\epsilon) \]
continuity definition;;
    \[ \lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a) \]
intermediate value theorem;;
    \[ f\in C[a,b] \]
    \[ f(a) < 0 < f(b) \]
    \[ \therefore \]
    \[ \exists x\in [a,b]: f(x) = 0 \]
bounded theorem;;
    \[ f\in C[a,b] \]
    \[ \therefore \]
    \[ \exists N \ \forall x\in [a,b]: f(x) \leq N \]
extreme value theorem;;
    \[ f\in C[a,b] \]
    \[ \therefore \]
    \[ \exists y\in [a,b] \ \forall x\in [a,b]: f(x) \leq f(y) \]
archimedean property;;
    \[ \forall \epsilon > 0 \ \exists n\in N: \epsilon > \frac{1}{n} \]

# Derivates
accurate informal definition of derivate;; secant limit
definition of \( f \) differentiable in \( a \);; \( f \) is differentiable in \( a \) if exists
    \[ \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \]
difference between \( f', f'(a), f'(x) \);; \( f' \) is a function, \( f'(a) \) is a number, \( f'(x) \) is used as a number and as a function
differentiability implies continuity theorem;;
